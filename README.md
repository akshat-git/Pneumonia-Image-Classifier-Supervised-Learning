Used EfficientNet model and trained it on Pneumonia Chest X-Ray dataset. 
The dataset consists of nearly 5600 Chest X-Ray images and two categories (Pneumonia/Normal). 
Main aim for this project was to build a pneumonia classifier which can classify a Chest X-Ray scan that belongs to one of the two classes. 
Loads and fine tunes the pretrained EffiecientNet model and also creates a simple pytorch trainer to train the model itself.
